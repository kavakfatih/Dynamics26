# Meshing Decision Log

## ADR-MESH-0001 — Dynamics26 will develop an original meshing engine

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2026-09-05

### Context

The initial V1.2 roadmap considered integrating a mature external volume mesher. Research confirmed that Netgen, Gmsh, MMG, TetGen and CGAL provide valuable algorithms, architectures and benchmark ideas. The project direction has now changed: Dynamics26 should own the production meshing implementation.

### Decision

- Do not make Netgen, Gmsh, MMG, TetGen or CGAL the V1.2 production meshing engine.
- Develop original Dynamics26 meshing algorithms under the existing \`femcae::meshing\` architecture.
- Use peer-reviewed papers and mathematical references as primary algorithm sources.
- Use open-source code only for architecture/failure/test study under \`CLEAN_ROOM_POLICY.md\`.
- Preserve \`GeometryEntityId\` as CAD authority and \`SimulationMesh\` as solver mesh authority.
- Keep \`StructuredHexMesher\` as a validated baseline while the unstructured engine matures.

### Rationale

Advantages:

- full control of geometry/provenance contracts,
- no product dependence on a third-party meshing API,
- no inherited external implementation/license constraints in the core,
- ability to tune specifically for nonlinear/rubber automotive workflows,
- meshing research becomes an owned Dynamics26 competency.

Costs:

- substantially larger R&D effort,
- robust computational geometry is difficult,
- quality and failure handling must be earned through a large verification corpus,
- arbitrary CAD meshing arrives later than an adapter-based approach.

### Consequence

V1.2 should be treated as a staged meshing R&D program, not a single feature.

## ADR-MESH-0002 — Delaunay-first tetrahedral research track

**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Date:** 2026-09-05

### Context

Strong literature exists for incremental Delaunay, constrained boundary recovery and Delaunay refinement. Commercial/open systems also demonstrate Delaunay and advancing-front hybrids.

### Proposed direction

Start original volume-meshing research with:

1. robust geometric predicates,
2. incremental Delaunay tetrahedralization on point clouds,
3. constrained boundary recovery,
4. Delaunay refinement,
5. separate quality optimization.

Keep advancing-front tetra meshing as an independent research track and potential hybrid component.

### Why not accepted yet

Boundary recovery, sliver control, sizing behavior and CAD-surface strategy need experiments before the production algorithm family is fixed.

## ADR-MESH-0003 — Named Selection is a meshing scope

**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Date:** 2026-09-05

### Context

ANSYS and COMSOL both reuse persistent selections for mesh controls. Dynamics26 already owns a persistent Named Selection system.

### Proposed direction

Allow future mesh-control definitions such as local size to scope through persistent Named Selection ObjectIds, resolved into GeometryEntityIds before meshing.

### Constraint

The low-level meshing kernel receives resolved immutable geometry identities; it does not depend on Qt/ProjectModel/NamedSelectionService.
